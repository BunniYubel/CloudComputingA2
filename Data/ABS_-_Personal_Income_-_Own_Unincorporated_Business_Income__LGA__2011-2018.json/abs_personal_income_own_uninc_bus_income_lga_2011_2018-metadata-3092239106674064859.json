The data covers the financial years 2011-12 to 2017-18, and is based on Local Government Areas (LGA) according to the 2018 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).\n<br><br>\n\nOwn unincorporated business income (OMUE income) is the profit or loss that accrues to owners of, or partners in, their own unincorporated businesses. Profit or loss is the value of the gross output of the enterprise after the deduction of operating expenses, including reportable superannuation contributions, depreciation and operating costs, but before income tax is taken out. Losses occur when operating expenses are greater than receipts and are treated as negative income.\n<br><br>\n\nOwn unincorporated business income includes the following data items on the Individual Tax Returns (ITR):\n<ul>\n<li>Net income or loss from business primary production</li>\n<li>Net income or loss from business non primary production</li>\n<li>Distribution from trusts primary production</li>\n<li>Net Personal Services Income</li>\n<li>Distribution from partnerships less foreign income non primary production</li>\n<li>Distribution from partnerships primary production</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n \nThese data exclude distributions from trusts for non-primary production activities as this may include aspects of investment income. It also excludes the income of working directors/owners of incorporated businesses who are classified as employees; consequently their income is included under Wage and salary income.\n<br><br>\n\n\"Net personal services income\" does not include income a person received as an employee, making it different from \"Attributed personal services income\".\n<br><br>\n\nAll monetary values are presented as gross pre-tax dollars, as far as possible. This means they reflect income before deductions and loses, and before any taxation or levies (e.g. the Medicare levy or the temporary budget repair levy) are applied. The amounts shown are nominal, they have not been adjusted for inflation. The income presented in this release has been categorised into income types, these categories have been devised by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to closely align to ABS definitions of income.\n<br><br>\n\nThe statistics in this release are compiled from the Linked Employer Employee Dataset (LEED), a cross-sectional database based on administrative data from the Australian taxation system. The LEED includes more than 120 million tax records over seven consecutive years between 2011-12 and 2017-18.\n<br><br>\n\nPlease note:\n<ul>\n<li>All personal income tax statistics included in LEED were provided in de-identified form with no home address or date of birth. Addresses were coded to the ASGS and date of birth was converted to an age at 30 June of the reference year prior to data provision.</li>\n<li>To minimise the risk of identifying individuals in aggregate statistics, perturbation has been applied to the statistics in this release. Perturbation involves small random adjustment of the statistics and is considered the most satisfactory technique for avoiding the release of identifiable statistics, while maximising the range of information that can be released. These adjustments have a negligible impact on the underlying pattern of the statistics. Some cells have also been suppressed due to low counts.</li>\n<li>Totals may not align with the sum of their components due to missing or unpublished information in the underlying data and perturbation.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n\nFor further information please visit the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/methodologies/personal-income-australia-methodology/2011-12-2017-18\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>.\n<br><br> SUDO has made the following changes to the original data:\n<ul>\n<li>Spatially enabled the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/earnings-and-work-hours/personal-income-australia/latest-release#data-download\" target=\"_blank\">original data</a>.</li>\n<li>Set 'np' (not published to protect the confidentiality of individuals or businesses) values to Null.</li>\n</ul>","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"lga_code","type":"String","title":"LGA Code 2018","description":"lga_code","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"earners_persons_2017_18","type":"Double","title":"Earners (persons) 2017-18","description":"earners_persons_2017_18","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"lga_name","type":"String","title":"LGA Name 2018","description":"lga_name","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"main_source_pc_of_earners_2017_18","type":"Double","title":"Main source (% of earners)  2017-18","description":"main_source_pc_of_earners_2017_18","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"mean_aud_2017_18","type":"Double","title":"Mean ($) 2017-18","description":"mean_aud_2017_18","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"median_age_of_earners_years_2017_18","type":"Double","title":"Median age of earners (years) 2017-18","description":"median_age_of_earners_years_2017_18","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"median_aud_2017_18","type":"Double","title":"Median ($) 2017-18","description":"median_aud_2017_18","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"sum_aud_2017_18","type":"Double","title":"Sum ($) 2017-18","description":"sum_aud_2017_18","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","feature":{"key":"lga_code","geoLevel":"lga2018","geoField":"ignored","year":"2006","featureBbox":[96.81676569599999,-43.740509603,159.109219008,-9.142175977],"featureType":"country","featureInstance":"au","featureName":"Australia","referenceSystemIdentifier":"urn:x-ogc:def:crs:EPSG:4283","prefix":"","keyTransform":null},"states":[]}}
